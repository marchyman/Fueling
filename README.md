# Fueling

A play app to keep track of vehicle fuel use.  I'm using it to learn Apple
phone/watch interaction. All data is owned/persisted by the phone using
SwiftData.  SwiftData is used in a way that is not dependent upon SwiftUI.

Data flow between the watch and the companion app is described in comments
at the top of the file named MessageKey.swift.

I don't pretend to know what I'm doing.  The purpose of this app is as much
for me to learn as it is to do something useful.
